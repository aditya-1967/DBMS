Extended ER Features:
	
	Specialization:
		more fine tuning
		process of designating subgroupings within an entity
		represantaion : reversed triangle
		
		Two Types:
			-Disjoint (mutually exclusive entities)
			-Overlapping (mutually inclusive entities)
			
	Generalizations:
		commanality can be expressed by generalisation
		it is a containament relationship that exists between higher level entity set and one or more lower level entity sets
		represantaion : triangle
	
	Higher and Lower Level Entity set:
	             [Person]    higer level entity

					 []     lower level entity
	
	Total Generalizations or Specialization:
		each higer level entity must belong to lower level entity set
	
	Partial Generalizations or Specialization:
		some higer level entity may not belong to any lower level entity set
	
	Attribute Inheritance:
		attributes of higer level entity are inherited by lower level entity
	
	Aggregation:
		relationship set participating in relationship then aggregation is used
		relationship with other relationship
	

Types of Attributes:
	1. Single valued vs Multivalued:
		single valued has unique value of an attribute for each entity
		multi valued has more than one value of an attribute for an entity (double elipse (()) )
	
	2. Simple vs Composite Attributes:
		simple cannot be broken furthur (atomic)
		composite can be broken furthur 
	
	4. Given vs Derived Attributes:
		derived attributes can be derived from given attributes
		ex. age can be derived from DOB
		dotted elipse
	
	5. Prime(key) vs Non-prime Attributes(non-key):
		if attribute is part of primary key then it is called prime else non-prime
		prime attribute is (underlined)
