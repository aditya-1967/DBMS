ER Model:
	consists of collection of basic objects, called entities and of relationships among these objects

Entity:
	object in real world that is distinguishable from another objects

Entity Set:
	collection of similar entities

Attribute:
	entity is described using a set of attributes
	(properties)
	
Domain:
	unique set of values permitted for an attribute

Relationship:
	an association among two or more entities

Relationship Set:
	set of similar relationships

Key:
	an attribute or set of attributes whose values can be uniquely identfy an entity in a set

ER Diagram:

	graphical representation of ER Model
	
	1. Entity set -> rectangular box [entity set name]
	2. Relationship Set -> diamond box <>
	3. Attributes -> oval box/elipses ()

	Types of Relationships:
		1. Unary
			relationship b/w entities of same entity set
		2. Binary
			relationship b/w entities of two entity set
		3. Ternary
			relationship b/w entities of three entity set
	
	Descriptive Attribute:
		Attribute of relationship
	
	Mapping Cardinality:
		maximum number of relationship instance in which an entity can participate
		
		1. One to One:
			[1 entity] <--> <Relationship> <--> [1 entity]
		2. One to Many
			[1 entity] --> <Relationship> --> [many entities]
		3. Many to One
			[1 entity] <-- <Relationship> <-- [many entities]
		4. Many to Many
			[many entities] <--> <Relationship> <--> [many entities]
			
	Participation Constraints:
		specifies the presense of an entity when it is related to another entity in a relationship type
		
		1. Total (double line)
		2. Partial (single line)
	
	Weak vs Strong Entities:
		Weak:
			entity that cannot be uniquely identfied by its attributes alone
			representation - double rectangular [[]]
