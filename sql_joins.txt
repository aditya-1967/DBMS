# SQL Joins:
	needed to retrieve records more than one table collectively
	
	Types:
		1. Full Join (full oyer join)
		2. Inner Join (equal or simple join)
		3. Left Join (left outer join)
		4. Right Join (right outer join)
		5. Self Join
		
		# 2, 3, r are called natural joins
		
	# Requirment for Join:
		2 tables must have one commom column
	
	# Inner join:
		- tight join
		- only those data from common column from both the tables will be selected
		
		Syntax:
			select * from table1 inner join table2 on table1.column = table2.column
			
			without using inner join
			select * from table1, table2 where table1.column = table2.column
		
		- works line intersection
		# default inner join
		
	# Left join:
		- all data from left table
		- table1 left join table2:
			then all records from table1 and only matching records of table2 else filled with NULL
			
		Syntax:
			select * from table1 left join table2 on table1.column = table2.column
			
	# Right join:
		- all data from right table
		- table1 right join table2:
			then all records from table2 and only matching records of table1 else filled with NULL
			
		Syntax:
			select * from table1 right join table2 on table1.column = table2.column
	
	# Full join:
		- all records from both the tables
		- non matched values will be returned as NULL
		
		Syntax:
			select * from table1 full join table2 on table1.column = table2.column
	
	# Self join:
		- only one table involved in join
		
		Syntax:
			select * from table1 as t1, table2 as t2 where t1.column = t2.column
		
		
Cartesian Product:
	super set of all possible records
	no any commom column is needed between the tables (means condition of no commom column is needed)
	 Syntax:
		select * from table1, table2
	
	no of  cols = c1 + c2
	no. of rows = r1 * r2
