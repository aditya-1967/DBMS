SQL where command:
	used with select, update, delete, insert commands
	used to filter specific rows from table
	
	syntax:
		select * from table_name where column_name = 'value'
		# value in single quote if object, if numeric then not in single quote
		
		# sequence is very important while running the query
		ex: select city from customers where country = 'Germany'
			sequence:
				from -> where -> select
		
		# can we only use = with where?
			no
			operators with where:
				1. Relational
					a. equal =
					b. not equal <>
					c. less than or equal to <=
					d. greater than >
					e. less than <
					f. greater than or equal to >=
				
				2. Logical
					a. AND
					b. OR
					c. NOT
					
					# and/or is used for having multiple condition in where clause
				
				3. Between
					used to filer records in a specific range
					between lower bound and upper bound

Limit:
	used to limit number of fetched records from a huge databse table
	syntax:
	- select * from table_name limit number_of_rows
	- select * from table_name where (condition) limit number_of_rows
	
	- 4 records after leaving first 5 records
	select * from table_name limit 5, 4

Null Values:
	representation of missing value/ no value
	
	select column_name from table_name where column_name is NULL
	
	# primary key should always be distinct and not null
	
Aggregate Functions:
	performs a calculation on multiple values and return single value
	
	1. min:
		used with select
		select min(column_name) from table_name
	2. max:
		used with select
		select max(column_name) from table_name
	3. sum:
		used with select
		select sum(column_name) from table_name
		
	# all three above return single value
	
	4. count:
		select count(column_name) from table_name
		given number of records/rows
	
	5. avg:
		select avg(column_name) from table_name
		given average of records/rows
	
	# These aggregate functions ignores null values
	
IN Operator:
	the IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a where clause
	it is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions
	
	ex:
		find all such customers which are either from Germany, UK or France
		select * from customers where country = 'Germany' or country = 'UK' or country = 'France'
		
		select * from customers where country IN(Germany, UK, France)
	
	IN operator is used with subqueries
	
Alias:
	used to give temporary name to table or a cloumn in a table
	used to make table names or cloumn names more readable
	only exists for the duration of the query
	created with the keyword: AS
	
	ex:
		select * from customers AS cust
		select * from table_name AS temp_name
		
		select * from table_name.column_name
		(when using 2 tables)
		
		select cust.customer_name from customers AS cust
		
		select customer_name AS name from customers
		
	# double quotations marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces
		select customer_name AS [Customer Name] from customers
	
	# if query is big then:
		select customer_name AS name, contact_name AS contact
		from customers
		where country IN(Germany, UK, France)
