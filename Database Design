Data Models:
	a collections of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and consistensy contraints
	
	-Entity Relation Model (ER Model)
	-Relational Model

ER Model:
	consists of collection of basic objects, called entities and of relationships among these objects

Relational Model:
	collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data

Other Data Models:
	-Object Oriented Data Model
	-Network Data Model
	-Hierachial Data Model

Database Design:
	1. Requirement Analysis
	2. Conceptual Database Design (on paper designing of database conceptually organised)
		- ER Modelling
	3/5. Schema Refinement
	4. Logical Database Design (using tools)
		- Relation Modelling
	6. Physical Database Design (how database will be stored on disk)
		-Decide the data structure to data base
		-indexing
	7. Security Design

Standard Database Design:
	- ER Diagram -> Refinement -> Relational Database Tables
