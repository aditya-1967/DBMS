SQL Group by, Having, Set Operators:
	
	Group By:
		used in collaboration with the select statement to arrange identicle data into groups
		
		Syntax:
			select * from table_name group by column_name
			
		# where cannot be used after using group by
	
	Having:
		used if we need to filter the result set based on aggregate functions such as min(), max(), sum(), avg() and count()
		was introduced because where clause does not support aggregate functions.
		also group by must be used before having clause
		
		ex:
			select sum(price), c_id from products group by c_id having sum(price) > 200
	
	# where is used before group by
		ex:
			select sum(price), c_id, s_id
			from products
			where s_id > 2
			group by c_id
			having c_id > 2
	
	# order of execution
		where -> group by -> having
	
	Where vs Having:
		Having:
			checks the condition on a group of rows
			used with aggregate functions
			executed after group by 
		Where:
			checks the condition on each individual row
			cannot be used with aggregate functions
			executed before group by
	
	Set Operators:
		used to combine results from two or more select statements
		# no. of cols from both the select statements must be same
		
		Syntax:
			(select * from table_name1) set_operator (select * from table_name2)
		
		1. Union
		2. Union All
		3. Intersect
		4. Minus or Excpet (set differnce)
		
		# join combines two tables, but set combines two select statements
		
		- Union:
			(select * from table_name1) union (select * from table_name2)
			duplicates are eliminated
		
		- Union All
			(select * from table_name1) union all (select * from table_name2)
			duplicates are not eliminated
		
		- Intersect
			(select * from table_name1) intersect (select * from table_name2)
			selects only common rows from both the select statements
		
		- Minus/Excpet
			(select * from table_name1) minus (select * from table_name2)
			it selects only those rows which are unique in first select statement
			A - (A intersect B)
