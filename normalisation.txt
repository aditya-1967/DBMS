Normalisation:
	process of minimizing redundancy (duplicacy) from a relation or set of relations
	redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies
	
	-Delete Anomaly:
		if we are deleting some kind of detail, then some other will also be deleted which cannot be retrieved again
		# cause:
			keeping those attributes together which should not be kept together
	
	-Insertion Anomaly:
		if we insert a new detail, then there will be anomaly if the primary key of that detail is not available
		
	-Update Anomaly:
		if updation is not complete, due to redundancy
	
	Normalisation is a process of grouping attributes into  well structured relations, that contain minimum redundancy
	-It focuses on characteristics of specific entites
	-One relation should have one theme
	
Process of Normalisation:

1NF:
	a relation R is said to be 1NF if there is no multivalued attribute in R
	-to remove multivalued attribute:
		-soln 1: multiple rows (no primary key)
		-soln 2: multiple columns (space wastage)
		-soln 3: decompose multivalued attribute into new relation with primary key of original relation

2NF:
	a relation R is said to be in 2NF it is already in 1NF and there is no any non-prime attribute in R which is partially dependent on prime attribute of R
	
	Partial Dependency:
		Assume a relation R(A, B, C, D, E)
		C. key = CD
		prime attribute - C, D
		non Prime attribute - A, B, E
		
		CD can together derive A, B, C, D, E, but if
		C derives A, B, E or
		D derives A, B, E
		then partial dependency exist
	
		i.e. if prime attribute alone derives a non prime attributes
		
		parital dependencies will not exist if candidate key is atmoic
	
	To remove partial dependencies:
		we need to decompose the relation into a new relation with attributes which are in partial dependency
		the non prime attribute will be removed from the original relation and be added to new relation with the prime attribute
		
		ex:
			R(A, B, C, D)
			partial dpendency : B->D
			new tables R1(A, B, c) and R2(B, D)

3NF:
	a relation R is said to be in 3NF if it is already in 2NF and there is no non-prime attribute in R which is transitively dependent on key of R
	
	To remove transitive dependencies:
		we will again do decomposition
		for ex:
			R(A, B, C, D)
			transitive dependencies: AB -> C, C -> D
			after decomposition:
			R1(A, B, C) R2(C, D)

BCNF (Boyce Codd Normal Form):
	A relation R is said to be in BCNF if it is already in 3NF and for every functional dependency A -> B, A should be a super key in R
	
	if there is a FD where A is not a primary key, then we have to decompose that FD into new relation
