DBMS

Data: raw info

Database: collection of data, more organised, structured

DBMS:
	- collection of inter-related data and set of programs to access those data
	access to means to retrieve info or to perform different operations on data

Goals of DBMS:
	-providing a way to store and retrieve databse info that is both convenient and efficient
	-ensure the safety of the info

Applications of Database:
	-Airlines
	-Travels
	-Hotels
	-Educational Institutions
	-Finance
	-Banking

Why DBMS?
	Disadvantage of file system:
		-data redundancy(duplicacy) and inconsistency(having two different values)
		-difficulty in accessing data
		-data isolation
		-integrity problems (applying constraints)
		-atomicty problems (rollback to previous state)
		-concurrent access anomalies (mutual exclusion)
		-security problems
		
Instance:
	the collection of info stored in the database at a particular moment

Schema:
	overall design of database

Database Languages:
	-Data Defination Language (DDL)
		schema related changes
	-Data Manipulation Language (DML)
		values related changes
		two types
		-Procedural:
			requires a user to specify what data are needed and how to get those data
		-Non Procedural:
			requires a user to specify what data are needed without spicifying how to get those data (SQL)

Database Users and Admin:
	-Naive Users #UnSophisticated
	-Application Programmer #UnSophisticated
	-Sophisticated Users
	-Specialised Users
	-Database Adminstrators

View of Data:
	-Physical Level
		how data is stored in disk
	-Logical Level
		design of table stored in disk but do not know how
	-View Level
		part of database visible to user

	Physical -> Logical -> View
	
Database System Architecture:
	-Storage Manager
	-Query Processor Components
	
	command -> query processor -> storage manager
	
2 Tier:
	[User -> Application] -> (network) -> Database system

3 Tier:
	[User -> Application client] -> (network) -> [Application server -> Database system]
