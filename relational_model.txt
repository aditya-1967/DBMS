Relational Model:
	uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationship among those data
	
Attribute (field):
	attributes are used to describe relations
	or
	columns of relations (just columnn name not values)

Tuple or Record:
	a row in relation

Instance:
	snapshot of data in the database at a given instant in time

Database Schema:
	logical design of database
	-Relation_name(attribute1, attribute2,...)
	
Domain:
	a unique set of values permitted for an attribute

Domain Constraint:
	speicifies an important condition that we want each instance of relation to satisfy

Degree or Arity:
	number of attributes in a relation

Cardinality:
	number of tuples in a relation

Relational Database:
	collection of relations
	NULL: representation of no value

Keys:
	an attribute or a set of attributes whose values can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation
	
	Types of Keys:
		1. Super Key:
			all possible keys of a relation
			super set of all keys
		2. Candidate Key:
			minimal super key
			a key whose proper subset is not a key
		3. Primary Key:
			chosen candidate key for implementation
		4. Alternate Key:
			all candidate keys apart from primary key
		5. Foreign Key:
			# Referential Integrity:
				we wish to ensure that a value that appears in one relation for a given set of attributes also appears for a certain set of attributes in another relation
			it follows referential integrity constraint
			can be null
